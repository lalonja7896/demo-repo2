#Commits 
we will have a master Branch and then we can have branches that will modify something in the main branch 
we can also modify something specific in a branch, but each branch is only keeping changes in the original branch 
So:

We have a Master Branch and a Feature Branch were we can make changes and modifications and at the end merge everything into a final one.
